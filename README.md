## Queston 01

<p>You've been provided with a dataset containing informaton about crops, including their nutrient levels 
(N, P, K), environmental factors (temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall), and corresponding labels. Your task 
is to create a predictve model that recommends the best three crops based on the provided conditons. 
Using machine learning techniques, build a model that takes into account the input features and predicts 
the most suitable crops for cultvaton.<br>
Find the data set here<br>
Tasks:<br>
<ol>
<li>Data Exploraton and Preprocessing:</li>
  <ol>
    <li> Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributons.</li>
    <li>Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding 
      categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.</li> 
  </ol>

<li>Model Training:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, 
    Support Vector Machines) for building the predictve model.</li> 
    <li>Split the dataset into training and testng sets.</li> 
    <li>Train the model using the training data.</li> 
  </ol>

<li>Model Evaluaton:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Evaluate the trained model's accuracy in predictng the crop labels using the testng dataset.</li>
    <li>Provide insights into how well the model performs in suggestng appropriate crops based on 
    the given environmental conditons.</li>
  </ol>

<li>Joblib Model Creaton and Predicton:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a joblib model (.joblib) from the trained model.</li>
    <li>Use the created joblib model to make predictons on new environmental conditons.</li>
    <li>Calculate the accuracy of the predictons.</li>
  </ol>

  
</ol>

Submission Requirements:<br>
1. Submit your Python code implementng the data preprocessing, model training, evaluaton, and 
predicton.<br>
2. Include a brief report discussing the approach taken, challenges faced, insights gained from 
model evaluaton, and suggestons for improving the model's performance.<br>
3. Provide instructons for running your code and reproducing the results.<br>
Note: You may use any relevant libraries and techniques for this task, ensuring clear documentaton and 
organizaton of your code<br>
